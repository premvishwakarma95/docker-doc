## 1. What is Docker?
Docker is a tool that lets you package your app + dependencies + environment into a container.  
👉 Think like:
- Your Node.js app
- MongoDB
- Environment variables
- ➡️ All packed into one “box” = container

## 2. Why Docker is Important?
As a MERN/Node dev, Docker helps you:  
- Run MongoDB without installing locally
- Run node without installing locally
- Avoid “works on my machine” bugs
- Easily deploy apps
- Manage multiple services (API + DB + Redis)

## 3. Key Concepts
### 🧱 Image  
- Blueprint/template
- Like a class in OOP
👉 Example: `node:18`, `mongo`

### 📦 Container
- Running instance of an image
- Like an object of a class

### 🐳 Docker Engine
- The system that runs containers

👉 Image = Blueprint  
👉 Container = Running App from that Blueprint
